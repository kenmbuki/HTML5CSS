            <h2><em>Chapter 10  - Floating and Positioning </em></h2>

            <div>
                <p>Sure, CSS makes content look good with font changes, backgrounds, and all the rest,
                but what about accomplishing basic layout tasks? Enter floating and positioning.
                </p>

                <p>Unlike balloons, floated elements can’t float upward
                Keep floats below their predecessors, and the floats levels with their context. A floating element must be placed as high as possible.    </p>
            </div>

            <p>Items Covered :-</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Floating</li>

            </ol>
            <div id="sidebar">
                <p>Given such a case, a tiled image could be applied to the body background. This image
                would show through the gaps created by the margins, which could certainly be wid-
                ened if the author saw fit to do so.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <img src="img/minion.jpg" height="50" width="50" class="sideline">
                <p class="box">To resurrect the paper-and-plastic analogy from Chapter 7, the plastic margins
                around an image never overlap the plastic surrounding other floated elements.
                    containing block. A floated element’s containing block is the nearest block-level
                ancestor element.</p>
                <p class="first">The CSS1 and CSS2 specifications explicitly state that user agents are not required to reflow previous content to
                accommodate things that happen later in the document. In other words, if an image
                is floated up into a previous paragraph, it may simply overwrite whatever was
                already there.
                </p>
                <img src="img/minion.jpg" class="sider" height="50" width="50">

                <h3>Why Doubt David the minion?</h3>

            </div>

            <p class="second">
                Thanks to 'position: relative', this paragraph establishes a containing
                block for any of its descendant elements that are absolutely positioned.
                Since there is such an element-- <em>that is to say, <b>a boldfaced element
                that is absolutely positioned,</b> placed with respect to its containing
                block (the paragraph)</em>, it will appear within the element box generated
                by the paragraph.
            </p>



            <div class="aside">
                <p class="third">CSS2.1 clarified one aspect of floated-element behavior: a floated element will
expand to contain any floated descendants.</p>
